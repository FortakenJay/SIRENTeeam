final descicion: A behavioral experiment in mindful tech usage
Inspired by Pavlov's early work in classical conditioning, this project is a subtle intervention into the automatic pull of social media.

Pavlov, while studying digestion, noticed dogs began to salivate not just at food, but at the appearance of the person who usually fed them. Through repeated pairings, a neutral stimulus — like a sound — could trigger a biological response.

We’re borrowing that idea — and inverting it.

Each time the user opens a chosen social media app, they’re presented with an image they’ve personally selected through a guided filter. From there, the app scrapes the web, finding related visuals based on the discomfort preferences the user has written — imagery they find off-putting or unpleasant.

Over time, this pairing begins to shift the reflex. The moment of automatic scrolling becomes something to hesitate, to reconsider.

No manipulation. No dark patterns.
Only a conscious choice, reinforced through repetition.

The experience is fully opt-in. The terms are transparent. The user stays in control.

A nudge.
A quiet interruption.
A way back to presence.
