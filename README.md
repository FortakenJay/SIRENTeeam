## Initial Ideas
1. total notification summarizer in 1 app. ie) whatsapp, ig, disc, imess, etc. all compiles into 1 summary
2. reading disability extension
3. brainrot minimizer by pavlov experiment
4. funny encryption using a random video as reference (ie minecraft chunk or watching 10 hour wall dry)
5. funny webscrapper
6. game deals tracker
7. homework gantt chart
8. newspaper sorter depending on mood and likes at the moment
9. water reminder depending on current weather
10. study timer that blocks everything and unlocks everything
11. automatic replier AI
12. daily fortune cookie
13. gas prices indicator with map and stuff
14. Resume Keyword Scanner
15. Image-to-Quote Poster (Upload an image → detect mood/theme → generate a quote → overlay on image.)
16. Fortune Cookie Generator (Click a button → get a funny or wise "fortune")

Not a tracker. A disruptor.

Most habit apps fail because they rely on motivation — fragile, fleeting.
This project doesn't ask you to try harder. It changes the cue itself.

Inspired by Pavlov's work on classical conditioning, it targets the reflex, not the result.

While studying digestion, Pavlov noticed dogs began to salivate not just at food, but at the person who fed them. A neutral trigger became a biological prompt. Through repetition, the brain rewired.

We’re using the same method — in reverse.

Each time a user opens a chosen social media app, they’re shown a personally selected image — chosen via filters that help them define what they find disturbing or discomforting. Then, using web scraping, the app finds more related imagery aligned with those cues.

The result? A conditioned association between the urge to scroll and a feeling of unease.

Over time, the reflex erodes. The loop weakens.

No streaks. No badges. No charts.
Just an intentional friction added to the cycle.

Fully opt-in. Fully transparent.
No manipulation. No data games.
Just you, with space to pause.

A nudge.
A quiet interruption.
A way back to presence.

## Inspiration
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Doomscrolling is a sickness of the modern mind. Merriam-Webster calls it “the tendency to keep scrolling through bad news, even though that news is saddening, disheartening, or depressing.” It's Evil, isn't it? But that definition feels too gentle. Doomscrolling is more like a decay. It's watching your own cognition slowly unravel, swiping through fear and disaster like it's ambient noise. The numbers don’t lie. In one study, 49.3% of people reported moderate doomscrolling habits, and 16.5% admitted to severe behavior—patterns of consumption that resemble addiction more than choice (PMC9580444). Children, teens, adults—we’re all caught in the loop, feeding an algorithm that feeds on us. It’s not just information we’re absorbing; it’s anxiety, outrage, despair. And the platforms know it. They’ve weaponized dopamine, hijacked our reward systems for clicks and watch time (Jefferson Health).

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Be honest—do you even remember what you saw five reels ago? Your brain doesn’t hold on to any of it. It’s mush. Brain rot—that was Oxford’s word of the year, and for good reason. We’re living in a reality where mental fragmentation is normalized, even aestheticized. Our collective attention span is a glitching cursor. The internet is no longer just a tool, it’s an environment—and in that environment, scrolling is a survival instinct gone rogue. We’re hunting for meaning in an endless feed of noise. But you won't find it. Just another clip, another outrage, another second gone.

# Methodology

## 1. Conceptual Framework
This project applies principles of classical conditioning to disrupt habitual social media usage through an aversive stimulus. Unlike traditional habit trackers or screen-time limiters, this approach focuses on altering the **cue-response loop** by introducing discomfort at the point of engagement.

The system is user-consensual and transparent, ensuring ethical implementation through an explicit opt-in agreement and a customizable experience.

## 2. User Setup
Upon installation, the user is guided through an onboarding process where they:

- Select the specific social media apps they wish to reduce usage of.
- Complete a preference form describing visual elements, topics, or concepts they personally find uncomfortable or off-putting.
- Review and agree to clear terms of use detailing the psychological basis of the app and how their preferences will be used.

## 3. Stimulus Generation
After user input:

- The app filters and suggests a base image that matches the user’s discomfort profile.
- A web scraper is triggered to retrieve and curate similar images in real-time using search terms generated from the user's descriptions.
- These images are periodically updated to avoid desensitization.

## 4. Conditioning Cycle
Each time the user attempts to open a selected social media app:

- The app intercepts the action momentarily.
- A curated image from the discomfort set is displayed fullscreen for a brief, fixed duration (e.g., 2–5 seconds).
- The user is then redirected to the app as usual.

This process is repeated consistently, creating an association between the act of opening the app and the unpleasant image stimulus.

## 5. Adaptivity and Feedback

- The system allows for user feedback and continuous re-calibration of discomfort profiles.
- Periodic reminders prompt users to reflect on their screen time trends without showing usage metrics, focusing instead on emotional awareness.
- Users can adjust the intensity, categories, or frequency of image updates to avoid overexposure or emotional distress.

## 6. Ethical Considerations

- All operations are conducted with informed consent.
- No personally identifiable information is stored or shared.
- The discomfort images are not meant to traumatize or cause harm but to serve as gentle behavioral nudges.
